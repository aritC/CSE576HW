    "Definition": "In this task you will be given two sentences. You have to evaluate the similarity between both the sentences and classify them into classes from 0-5 as follows:\n0 : The two sentences are completely dissimilar.\n1 : The two sentences are not equivalent, but are on the same topic.\n2 : The two sentences are not equivalent, but share some details.\n3 : The two sentences are roughly equivalent, but some important information differs/missing.\n4 : The two sentences are mostly equivalent, but some unimportant details differ.\n5 : The two sentences are completely equivalent, as they mean the same thing.",
